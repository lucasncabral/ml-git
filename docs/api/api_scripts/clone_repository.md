## Cloning an ml-git repository

This notebook describes how to clone an ML-Git repository.

### Notebook state management

If you have already run this notebook or another in this same folder, it is recommended that you perform a state restart by executing the cell below, because previously performed state changes may interfere with the execution of the notebook. Be aware, that procedure does not affect any remote repository.


```python
%cd /api_scripts
!rm -rf ./logs
!rm -rf .ml-git
!rm -rf ./datasets
```

#### To start using the ml-git api we need to import it into our script


```python
from ml_git.api import MLGitAPI
```

    

#### After importing you can use the api clone method, passing the url of the git repository as a parameter.


```python
repository_url = '/local_ml_git_config_server.git'
api = MLGitAPI()

api.clone(repository_url)
```

    INFO - Metadata Manager: Metadata init [/local_server.git/] @ [/api_scripts/tmprr5gsm40/mlgit/.ml-git/models/metadata]
    INFO - Metadata Manager: Metadata init [/local_server.git/] @ [/api_scripts/tmprr5gsm40/mlgit/.ml-git/labels/metadata]
    INFO - Metadata: Successfully loaded configuration files!


    

#### When the clone is successfully completed, the entities are initialized and ready for use.
